<br/>
Also, administrators can login from the welcome screen and manage the information for their shelter or storage center. Shelter administrators can see a list of all recent resevations people have made, and for how many people. When each of these reservation owners arrive and they have a reservation, they should just for their reservation code and see if it's on the list.
